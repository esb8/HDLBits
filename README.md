# HDLBits Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/), an online platform for learning digital design and Verilog through a series of hands-on problems. 

The problems cover a wide range of fundamental topics in digital logic, including:

- Basic gates and combinational logic
- Multiplexers and decoders
- Sequential circuits and finite state machines
- Timing, latches, and flip-flops
- Structural and behavioral Verilog

## Goals

- Build a strong understanding of digital design principles
- Practice writing clean and correct Verilog code
- Prepare for future work in FPGA or ASIC design

## Notes

- Each module is written to be self-contained and match the problem specification
- File naming typically follows the problem name on HDLBits
