# HDLBits Solutions
## Overview
This repository contains my solutions to [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/), an online platform for learning digital design and Verilog through a series of hands-on problems. 

HDLBits is a useful tool for building a strong understanding of digital design principles. And to practice writing clean and correct Verilog code

## General Learning Criteria

- Basic gates and combinational logic
- Multiplexers and decoders
- Sequential circuits and finite state machines
- Timing, latches, and flip-flops
- Structural and behavioral Verilog

## Sections

The problems cover a wide range of fundamental topics in digital logic and are seperated in sections including:
### Verilog Language (28 Problems)
- Declearing wires/nets, inputs/ouputs, gates.
- Vectors, part selection, replication.
- Bitwise, logical and conditional operators.
### Circuits (35 Problems)



## Notes

- Each module is written to be self-contained and match the problem specification
- File naming typically follows the problem name on HDLBits
